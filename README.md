# Crystallize Libraries

Here are managed all the Crystallize Libraries.

In order to simplify their maintenance they are all in this Git Repository.

All contributions will happen here:

-   PRs and Issues are therefore open, discuss, contribute in one place
-   Many things will be shared accross the `components`: Coding Standards, CI & Automations, Tests, etc.

âœ… Nevertheless, all the `compoenents` (here library) will continue to be independant and pushed in their own repository. (through magic mechanisms that we have internally)

## Contributions

### Conventions

-   Pull Requests and Issues should start with `[$COMPONENT_NAME]`
-   CI will fail if Coding Standars are not OK
-   CI will fail if Tests are not OK

### Coding Standards

To run them locally:

```bash
make codeclean
```

### Tests

To run them locally:

```bash
make tests
```

> It will run the Mono Repo Tests and the tests in each `components`

### Demo app (Github Page)

You can test on that live demo page here: https://crystallizeapi.github.io/libraries/

This React App is built from this repository as well, to run it:

```bash
make start-demo-app
```

Then you can access it: http://localhost:3000/libraries (it in a subfolder like on Github.io)

> This app is then built in production mode and deployed on Github Pages via Github Actions.

## Adding a new Component (Library)

```bash
make add-component COMPONENT=my-new-component
```

> If not already done, you still need create the Github sub-repository and add an entry in `components/manifest.json`
