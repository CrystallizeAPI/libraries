# Crystallize Libraries

Here are managed all the Crystallize Libraries.

In order to simplify their maintenance they are all in this Git Repository.

All contributions will happen here:

- PRs and Issues are therefore open, discuss, contribute in one place
- Many things will be shared accross the `components`: Coding Standards, CI & Automations, Tests, etc.

âœ… Nevertheless, all the `compoenents` (here library) will continue to be independant and pushed in their own repository. (through magic mechanisms that we have internally)

## Managed Repositories

| Libraries                                                                      | Licence(s) |

| [JS Api Client](https://github.com/CrystallizeAPI/js-api-client)               |  ![mit]    |

## Contributions

- Pull Requests and Issues should start with `[$COMPONENT_NAME]`

## Adding a new Component (Library)

```bash
make add-component COMPONENT=my-new-component
```

> If not already done, you still need create the Github sub-repository and add an entry in `components/manifest.json`
